git rebase master #To add files from master to feature(sub-branch) #comes helpful when master is update with some new files which is unavailable in feature
git merge master #To merge master to feature

difference between rebase and merge:
rebase put all the files from master first which are came to it after update. Ex: m1 m2 m3 m4 f1
merge will put files in a sequence. Ex: m1 m2 m3 f1 m4 

if you are in feature branch preference is given to rebase command 
if you are in master branh preference is given to merge command 

git mergetool --tool=vimdiff
